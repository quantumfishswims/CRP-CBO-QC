# CRP-CBO-QC

This repository contains contains Python-based implementations of the cavity Born-Oppenheimer (CBO) Hartree Fock 
and Coupled Cluster (CC) methods in the cavity reaction potential (CRP) formulation for applications in ab initio
vibro-polaritonic chemistry. 

The theory was presented [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18355) and [there](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10100) 
and published under DOI:10.1063/5.0231528 and DOI:10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01604

CRP-CBO-QC requires python, pyscf and numpy.

## CRP-RHF

Mean-field approach to electronic energies in ab initio vibro-polaritonic chemistry. 

## CRP-CCSD

Correlated approach to electronic energies in ab initio vibro-polaritonic chemistry. 
Contains self-consistent and linearised CRP-CCSD versions.
