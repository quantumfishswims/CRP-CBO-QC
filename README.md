# CRP-CBO-QC

This repository contains contains Python-based implementations of the cavity Born-Oppenheimer (CBO) Hartree Fock 
and Coupled Cluster (CC) methods in the cavity reaction potential (CRP) formulation for applications in ab initio
vibro-polaritonic chemistry. 

The theoretical background, implementation and model applications was presented in two publications:

- E.W. Fischer, J. Chem. Phys. 161, 164112 (2024), doi:10.1063/5.0231528
- E.W. Fischer, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX, doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01604


CRP-CBO-QC requires python, pyscf and numpy.

## CRP-RHF

Mean-field approach to electronic energies in ab initio vibro-polaritonic chemistry. 

## CRP-CCSD

Correlated approach to electronic energies in ab initio vibro-polaritonic chemistry. 
Contains self-consistent and linearised CRP-CCSD versions.
